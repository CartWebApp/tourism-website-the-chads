        <h3>Nature/Parks</h3>
        <p>
          There are many natural wonders in Canada. The first that may come to many people's heads is the classic Niagara Falls. Niagara Falls is located near the border between Canada and the United States which is fed by the Great Lakes. The memorizing spectacle isn’t the only thing there though. When you’re done you can explore the 160 wineries on the Niagara Peninsula, go for a hike in Niagara Glen, or browse the boutiques in charming Niagara-on-the-Lake. There is also the charming Banff National Park located in Alberta. The natural beauty and rich history are what set it apart from other national parks. You can join guided hikes at Lake Louise, such as the iconic trek up to the Plain of the Six Glaciers and an adorable alpine tea house built by Swiss guides in 1924. The enchanting Aurora Borealis can be viewed in the territory of Yukon. Though the Aurora Borealis can be seen in many northern countries, from Iceland to Russia, the Yukon in Canada is considered one of the best places in the world to see it, with best viewing between November and March. When dawn breaks, go dog sledding or snow shoeing, or embark on a northern wildlife safari. Then, warm up at Takhini hot springs, natural pools close to the Yukon’s capital city of Whitehorse.
