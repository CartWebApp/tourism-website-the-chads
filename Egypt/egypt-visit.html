        <h3>Egypt Loding Options</h3>
        <p>
            After a long day of travelling, some rest is much needed. Hotels in Egypt can vary a lot, there are many great 5 star hotels, but a lot more 1-2 star hotels, these are usually what you will come across. Hotel touting is also a big issue, those touting will stand outside of airports to look for foreigners and convince them that their hotel is the only one available. RoughGuides claims that these touts will take foreigners to “grotty and overpriced places that depend on touts.”. There are also 12 official hostels in Egypt, they offer reasonably priced lodging, but they have a daytime lock-out, meaning you have to go during some specific hours of the day, as well as a night curfew. Hostels also separate people by gender and whether they’re a foreigner or not. Camping is another option in Egypt, although the most difficult of the 3 options, as campsites are generally reserved for Egyptian families on the coast. The more preferred method is finding a hotel with a campsite attached to it, this comes with the added benefit of shower and bathroom facilities.

        <h3>Getting to Egypt</h3>
        <p>
            Egypt is a pretty straightforward place to travel to. Most places in Europe have direct flights to Cairo, but it's pretty reliable to find an indirect flight from all around the world. It is possible to travel to Egypt via land travel, but those methods are restricted to neighboring countries. Flights to Cairo can get quite costly during the weekends, it’s recommended flights are booked in advance and on a weekday. According to RoughGuides, the best time to fly is between November and March, this time period offers the best prices for Egypt flights.

        <h3>Traveling Throughout Egypt</h3>
        <p>
            Flying is great, but they stop after arriving at the destination, some transportation after the landing is much needed. Luckily Egypt offers many of the same transportation options one would expect. Trains, most reliable for traveling between cities in Egypt, most trains come equipped with air conditioning. RoughGuides says that the most popular method of transportation is Egypts taxi services, they cover almost all cities, are faster than taking a train, and fairly priced. Most taxis take the form of a bus that can carry many people to their destinations. Driving yourself, however, is not for the faint of heart, traffic can get heavy very fast, though the locals don’t seem too bothered. Something to note is that the legal driving age in Egypt is actually 25 years old, in addition you can’t drive after the age of 70.
