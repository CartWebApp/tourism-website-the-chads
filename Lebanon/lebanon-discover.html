        <h3>Jeita Grotto</h3>
        <p>
          Tourists in Lebanon must visit the Jeita Grotto, a cave system in
          Lebanon. The Jeita Grotto which is one of the most beautiful scenic
          views of the mountainous caves of Lebanon.
          <a
            style="text-decoration: none"
            class="text-link"
            href="http://jeitagrotto.com/"
            >The Jeita Grotto official webpage</a
          >
          says, “The grotto was discovered in 1836 by an American missionary
          who, venturing some 50 m into the cave, fired a shot from his gun and
          found a cavern of major importance.” Travelers can see that the Jeita
          Grotto contains immense beauty and history that is well worth seeing.
          <br />Additionally,
          <a
            style="text-decoration: none"
            class="text-link"
            href="https://www.beautifulworld.com/asia/lebanon/jeita-grotto/"
            >Beautifulworld.com</a
          >
          states, “A tour of the lower grotto involves a 1650ft (500m) electric
          boat trip along a subterranean, black lake. At first, you are met with
          resonant sounds of rushing water and cool air but, as the boat
          ventures further into the cave, profound silence is experienced.” This
          is clearly an amazing experience for any tourist looking for a trip in
          the city of Beirut.

          (completed 2nd century CE), only portions of which remain. It was a
          massive building, entered by a propylaea, or entranceway, leading to a
          hexagonal forecourt and then to a rectangular main court 343 feet
          (104.5 metres) long and 338 feet (103 metres) wide.” Baalbek has been
          a ground for many different religions since 9000 BC, so being in such
          a place where so much history lies is a wonderful experience for
          adventurous tourists. Additionally, it is the ground of the Temple of
          Jupiter, which is one of the biggest roman structures in the world.
