        <h3>Jeita Grotto</h3>
        <p>
          Tourists in Lebanon must visit the Jeita Grotto, a cave system in
          Lebanon. The Jeita Grotto which is one of the most beautiful scenic
          views of the mountainous caves of Lebanon. The Jeita Grotto official
          page says, “The grotto was discovered in 1836 by an American
          missionary who, venturing some 50 m into the cave, fired a shot from
          his gun and found a cavern of major importance.” Travelers can see
          that the Jeita Grotto contains immense beauty and history that is well
          worth seeing. Additionally, Beautifulworld.com states, “A tour of the
          lower grotto involves a 1650ft (500m) electric boat trip along a
          subterranean, black lake. At first, you are met with resonant sounds
          of rushing water and cool air but, as the boat ventures further into
          the cave, profound silence is experienced.” This is clearly an amazing
          experience for any tourist looking for a trip in the city of Beirut.

        <h3>Baalbek Roman Ruins</h3>
        <p>
          Many tourists come to Lebanon for the once in a lifetime views and
          Baalbek is no exception Baalbek is known for its beautiful structures
          from the Roman Age. Any lucky tourist can step foot on the same land
          that was once ruled by the Romans Hundreds of years before now. The
          CultureTrip.com says, “As significant holy grounds, Baalbek was a
          center for Mesopotamian, Roman, Christian and Islamic worship as each
          group introduced their own heritage to this sacred monument.” Clearly,
          this is a place of lots of history and even just stepping foot on it
          tourists will know. Additionally, Britannica.com says, “One of the
          principal structures on the site is the Temple of Jupiter (completed
          2nd century CE), only portions of which remain. It was a massive
          building, entered by a propylaea, or entranceway, leading to a
          hexagonal forecourt and then to a rectangular main court 343 feet
          (104.5 metres) long and 338 feet (103 metres) wide.” Baalbek has been a
          ground for many different religions since 9000 BC, so being in such a
          place where so much history lies is a wonderful experience for
          adventurous tourists. Additionally, it is the ground of the Temple of
          Jupiter, which is one of the biggest roman structures in the world.
