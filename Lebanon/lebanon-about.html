        <h3>Nature/Parks</h3>
        <p>
          Lebanon is most famously known for their Cedar trees and snow capped
          mountains. In-fact the Lebanese Flag contains a graphic of a Cedar
          Tree outline. Additionally, Lebanon also has a varying sub tropical
          weather which makes it a very nice place to visit during the warmer
          months. During winter in Lebanon there is an average of 30 to 40
          Inches of precipitation on most of the land and in the Mountains there
          tends to be heavy snowfall that lasts till early summer. <br />Lebanon
          has a couple of famous parks that are full of nature also. Firstly,
          Lebanon is home to the Forest of the Ceadars of God. This forest is
          home to most of Lebanons Cedars and it was given this name due to its
          heritage in the culture of the people of Lebanon. Secondly, Lebanon is
          also home to the Kadisha Valley which is a masive valley that is
          sometimes referred to as the "Holy Valley". This valley is located
          around the foot of Mount al-Makmal in northern Lebanon.

        <h3>History of Lebanon / Major Cities</h3>
        <p>
          Lebanon is known for its vast culture and history. It is home to many
          different types of people varying from simple religious differences to
          completely different backgrounds. It is known for not being very big
          and it is only about the size of Fresno County in California.
          Additionally, it is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the left,
          Israel to the South, and lastly Syria to the North and East. Lebanon
          is quite a small Country with only a very small population of
          7,660,000 Million people living there. Some of the Major Cities
          located in Lebanon are; Beirut, Capital, Tripoli, Sidon, Tyre, and
          Jouneih.

        <h3>Demographics of Lebanon</h3>
        <p>
          Lebanon is known for its varying culture and religions that are all
          spread into such a small area. Britannica.com states in a Ethnic
          Composition photo that Lebanon is made up of 71% Lebanese Arabs, 12%
          Palestine Arabs, 6.8% Armenians, 6.1% Kurd, and 3.8% of other
          countries. Clearly, Lebanon has a wide variety of backgrounds in such
          a small area which is partially why there are not that many big and
          famous cultural traditions there. Additionally, Britannica.com lists
          the Religion Composition of Lebanon in a photo: 27% Shi’i Muslim, 27%
          Sunni Muslim, 21% Maronite, 8% Greek Orthdox, 5.6% Druze, 5% Greek
          Catholic, and 6.4% of other religions. All these religions have great
          tensions with one other since they are all living within close
          quarters of each other. This causes many issues with under
          representation in Government since Lebanese politics are heavily
          affected by religious beliefs. For Example, BBC News states That
          Lebanon was in a “Lebanese civil war” for 15 years. Overall Lebanon
          has a great amount of diversity but this does lead to some
          difficulties with agreement politically and culturally.
