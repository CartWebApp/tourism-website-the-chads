        <h3>Lebanon Loding Options</h3>
        <p>
          Of course once tourists get there they will also need places to stay
          and there is a very small selection to choose from. Travellers main
          lodging options are hotels. Many of these hotels are absolutely
          wonderful and tourists won't regret staying at them. Additionally,
          there aren't many airbnbs in Lebanon because of the current economy
          issues. If tourists from 18-29 are looking for a nice area to stay,
          Downtown Beirut is the perfect option. It has perfect shopping areas
          next to it and is surrounded by tourist attractions in Lebanon.
          Xixerone.com says, “The central area of Beirut, also known as Downtown
          Beirut or Beirut Central District (BCD) is probably the best area to
          stay in Beirut. This neighbourhood concentrates most of the city’s
          tourist attractions, such as the Roman ruins, St. George’s Cathedral,
          the Lebanese Conservatory, the parliament and Nejmeh Square or Place
          de l’Étoile.” Clearly there are very many options that potential
          tourists from the age of 18-29 would love utilizing.

        <h3>Getting to Lebanon</h3>
        <p>
          There are many different forms of travel to get to Lebanon. Lebanon is
          at a vital crossroads for many of the Middle East Countries so if
          tourists are within the Middle East then getting to Lebanon will be
          very easy because it is only a drive away through the international
          highway. According to Britannica.com you can, “The road network
          traversing Lebanon includes international highways, which form part of
          major land routes connecting Europe with the Arab countries and the
          East.” Clearly, It is very easy for anybody nearby Lebanon to access
          it through the international highways. Unfortunately, there is no way
          to get there by a cruise, but there are daily ferries coming all the
          way from Cyprus if you live nearby in Europe. This leaves the only
          choice for North American and Asian travelers to fly. Flying will
          leave you at the Beirut-Rafic Hariri INternational Airport in Beirut,
          the capital.

        <h3>Traveling Throughout Lebanon</h3>
        <p>
          Once tourists are in Lebanon there are very many forms of
          transportation to use while you're there. Firstly, public buses and
          minivan transportation systems are very popular in Lebanon as well as
          the rest of the Middle East. Getting from the South to the North is
          also very easy in Lebanon. The Compass says, “...there are 2 main
          stations named Charles Helou and Cola Station. Charles Helou is ideal
          for traveling to the north, whereas Cola is to the South.”
          Additionally, self driving is not recommended in Lebanon due to the
          driving style of the people in the Middle Eastern Countries.
          Additionally, Uber and Lyft are also very good forms of transportation
          while in major cities like Beirut and Byblos.
