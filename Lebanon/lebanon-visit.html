        <h3>Lebanon Lodging Options</h3>
        <p>
          Of course once tourists get there they will also need places to stay
          and there is a very small selection to choose from. Travellers main
          lodging options are hotels. Many of these hotels are absolutely
          wonderful and tourists won't regret staying at them. Additionally,
          there aren't many airbnbs in Lebanon because of the current economy
          issues. If tourists from 18-29 are looking for a nice area to stay,
          Downtown Beirut is the perfect option. It has perfect shopping areas
          next to it and is surrounded by tourist attractions in Lebanon.
          <a

            >Xixerone.com</a
          >
          says, “The central area of Beirut, also known as Downtown Beirut or
          Beirut Central District (BCD) is probably the best area to stay in
          Beirut. This neighbourhood concentrates most of the city’s tourist
          attractions, such as the Roman ruins, St. George’s Cathedral, the
          Lebanese Conservatory, the parliament and Nejmeh Square or Place de
          l’Étoile.” Clearly there are very many options that potential tourists
          from the age of 18-29 would love utilizing.

        <h3>Getting to Lebanon</h3>
        <p>
          There are many different forms of travel to get to Lebanon. Lebanon is
          at a vital crossroads for many of the Middle East Countries so if
          tourists are within the Middle East then getting to Lebanon will be
          very easy because it is only a drive away through the international
          highway. According to
          <a
            style="text-decoration: none"
            class="text-link"
            href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Lebanon/Trade#ref23402"
            >Britannica.com</a
          >
          you can, “The road network traversing Lebanon includes international
          highways, which form part of major land routes connecting Europe with
          the Arab countries and the East.” Clearly, It is very easy for anybody
          nearby Lebanon to access it through the international highways.
          Unfortunately, there is no way to get there by a cruise, but there are
          daily ferries coming all the way from Cyprus if you live nearby in
          Europe. This leaves the only choice for North American and Asian
          travelers to fly. Flying will leave you at the Beirut-Rafic Hariri
          INternational Airport in Beirut, the capital.

        <h3>Traveling Throughout Lebanon</h3>
        <p>
          Once tourists are in Lebanon there are very many forms of
          transportation to use while you're there. Firstly, public buses and
          minivan transportation systems are very popular in Lebanon as well as
          the rest of the Middle East. Getting from the South to the North is
          also very easy in Lebanon.

            >The Compass</a
          >
          says, “...there are 2 main stations named Charles Helou and Cola
          Station. Charles Helou is ideal for traveling to the north, whereas
          Cola is to the South.” Additionally, self driving is not recommended
          in Lebanon due to the driving style of the people in the Middle
          Eastern Countries. Additionally, Uber and Lyft are also very good
          forms of transportation while in major cities like Beirut and Byblos.
